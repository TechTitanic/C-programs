# C++ programs
this is the first program of c++ 
here i have made a program using c++ in which we can print anything under inverted commas like:-
for example i want to print my name then it will be written as:-

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	cout<<"khushi";
  return 0;
 }
Here, (#) is the preprocessor which is compulsary for library function which is <iostream> which means input/output streams.
This should be under <> which is the heading and necessary thing to start any program of c++.
int stands for integer and main() is the function, these () brackets are important to call a function.
{
   Main function for executing output.
}
return 0 indicates that the program is sucessfully terminated.
i have done this program in an application name dev c++.
strings like alphabets or texts should always written in ("") double course.
using namespace std contains library functions in small programs in which std stands for standard.
